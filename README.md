# SafeHands
The SafeHands Password Manager application I built for Android
======================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
======================================================================================
Below are the Privacy Policy and EULA agreements I've created.
By using the application, you agree to both policies. Feel free to reach
out to me with any questions or concerns at feedback.safehands@gmail.com.

Please keep in mind that I am a hobbyist and made the app in my spare time for fun.
While I've done my best to follow best security practices outlined by Google,
I'm not a cyber security expert. The app is USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, and comes
as-is. I make no guarantees about the quality or security of the application.
It is merely a demonstration of some of the skills I have acquired recently.
Please enjoy.

PRIVACY POLICY
======================================================================================
Disclaimer
As the sole developer of SafeHands, I am a hobbyist producing a small app with no intent to monetize it. I am not a lawyer, but I have done my best to comply with standards and applicable laws.

Privacy Policy
Is any personal data collected?
Short Answer: No
Long Answer: Because the app keeps everything locally, no data, personally identifiable or otherwise, leaves the user’s phone. As the developer, I do not see any information the user provides to the app including, but not limited to, passwords, usernames, and any notes. Therefore, the data is not considered “collected.” However, obviously, the user provides information for the app to provide its service of helping to manage passwords. This information is kept in an encrypted file on the user’s phone (see below for more information)

Is any personal data shared with third parties?
Short Answer: No
Long Answer: No personal data is collected, and therefore no personal data is shared either. All information provided by the user is kept on the user’s phone and can only be seen by the user. There is no attempt to monetize the application through direct purchases, advertisements, or selling user data. As such, there is no third party involved with the application. Once the user downloads the application from the Google Play Store, the software is given as-is and the user is the sole party involved at that point.

How is the data stored?
Short Answer: Data is stored in an encrypted file that remains on the user’s device.
Long Answer: Any information the user provides to the app, including usernames, passwords, and notes, is kept in an encrypted file. This file is encrypted and decrypted on the user’s device, and done so with biometric verification.

How is the data protected?
Short Answer: Data is stored locally in an encrypted file that is encrypted with government-strength encryption algorithms.
Long Answer: (Intentionally left blank to avoid providing additional information to malicious actors who may use additional information to attempt to steal user information)

How do I opt-out or delete my data?
Short Answer: Because all data provided by the user stays on their device, all the user has to do to delete that data is to uninstall the app. There is no way to use the app without this locally stored data.
Long Answer: The app only stores whatever information the user provides. Should a user decide to stop providing information, nothing will change other than the limiting of the app’s functionality or usefulness. A password manager without any passwords is not managing anything and does not have any function. If a user wants to delete their information, they just need to uninstall the app. Then, Android will remove the local files and all locally held data will be deleted. Please note that in doing so, no passwords can be restored if the user decides to reinstall the app at a later time.

How do I view what information the app has stored?
Short Answer: Check the View Passwords screen and click on each password
Long Answer: The only information the app stores is the information provided by the user. This information can include usernames, passwords, and any notes. It also includes metadata about the password such as when it was last created or updated. All of this information can be viewed using the View Passwords screen and then clicking on a given password. The only other information stored is a few brief tags stored for settings management that do not identify the user in any way and pose no risk to the user, such as a flag to determine whether the user has opened the app or not. 

How long is user data stored?
Short Answer: User data is stored locally on the phone so long as the user has the app installed. If the user wishes to delete this data, they will need to uninstall the app, or manually delete passwords within the app itself.
Long Answer: Any data the app uses is only stored locally on the user’s phone. As such, the data is stored in the user’s phone as long as the app is installed. As soon as the app is uninstalled by the user, the data is deleted forever. Please note that this action cannot be undone. Users can also manually delete passwords and associated information (such as usernames and notes) within the app as well. This can be done at any time at the user’s discretion.

What will happen if this app is acquired by a business?
At this time, there is no intent to monetize the app or sell the app to any business. This app was made by myself as a hobbyist, and, at the time of writing this policy (3/29/2023), I intend to keep it this way. However, should this change, users will be notified. In this event, users will be subject to whatever policy is put in place by the new business. While the app is not, any changes made will be posted to this website.

Release of Liability
I have taken great measures and followed modern best practices to try to keep the app as secure as possible. However, there is no guarantee that malicious actors will not be able to abuse the system. This app was made as a hobby, and by downloading and using the app, the user agrees that they understand the above policy and agree to the risks involved in using the app, including potentially having their data stolen. I will do my best to prevent such a thing from occurring, but, as is the case with cyber-security, there is no guarantee. By proceeding to use the app, the user assumes all responsibility and cannot hold the developer, Samuel Sternman, accountable for any lost or stolen information.

Privacy Policy Changes
Should this policy be changed or modified, changes will be made to this website. Users will be notified if significant changes take place, but it is highly recommended that users return here from time to time to remain up to date.

We encourage feedback from any and all customers and users. Any issues or disputes should be sent to the below contact:
